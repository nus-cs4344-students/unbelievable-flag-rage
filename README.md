Notes for hosting on heroku
===========================
node_modules needed for heroku

Server.js has to be in root to work

Server is now running on site: http://unbelievable-flag-rage.herokuapp.com/

Notes for hosting on Testing Client Code
=========================================
Do not need to run server on local host, unless if you want to change the code in the server.

Client will be connected to server online even in debug
